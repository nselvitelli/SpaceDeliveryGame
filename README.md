# Space Delivery Game

Welcome!

Your goal is to deliver packages to as many planets/moons as you can.
There is a marker on your screen that will point you to your destination.
Fly through the target to deliver the package and get your next assignment!
Good luck, pilot!

## Screenshots

**Start of the game view. Targeting the red planet in view**

![Many Planets](./common/screenshots/many_planets.png)
**Looking over a large number of planets (green) and their moons (purple)**

![Overdrive](./common/screenshots/overdrive.png)
**The Field of View (FOV) is increased as the ship is flying incredibly fast so planets look skewed and more of the galaxy is visible**

![Score](./common/screenshots/scoreboard.png)
**The score increases when the ship visits the marked planet/moon (red)**

![Offscreen](./common/screenshots/offscreen.png)
**When the marked planet is offscreen the 'X' icon shows the direction the ship must fly to reach the planet. The ship is tilted slightly as the player is currently turning to the left with the mouse**
